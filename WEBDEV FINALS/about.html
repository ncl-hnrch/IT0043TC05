                <p id="p-border">Hello! I am Nicole Heinrich, currently a Freshman at FEU Institute of Technology taking the course BSIT-cst. I have a small background when it comes to programming, being a former ICT student at my old school. But even before I became an ICT student, HTML have always been fun and exciting for me!</p>
                <p id="p-border">I am a teamplayer and someone who always consider fair and balanced distribution of work. I have a lot of experience when working with a team as someone who is always chosen as a group's leader or representative. I am positive and have a lot of respect in my hands.</p>
                <p>I am well known to be an extrovert and outgoing person, someone who's easy to befriend and approach. I like meeting and befriending new people. Outside work I often play video games or watch shows or youtube clips. I don't do much inside my home and prefers to be outside. </p>
